In the 80th year since EPR paradox was proposed, 3 loophole free violation of Bell's inequality were presented in attempts to conclusively rule out local realism. But when the setup and the collected data in these reports are examined along with a) the physics concept of entanglement and b) precise interpretation of experiments, it shows that these tests were only performed on local real systems. Furthermore, neither locality nor fair sampling loophole was properly closed, not even individually. This analysis examines the wave function in various parts of the experiments, which sheds light on what actually happens in the experiments.
