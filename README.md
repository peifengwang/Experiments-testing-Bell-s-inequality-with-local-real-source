Analysis of reported violation of Bell's inequality shows that these experiments were actually performed on local real systems. In v1.0, it shows that non-locality arises from the lack of location variable in the mathematical formula of wave equation, and some experiments show more local reality then entanglement. In v2.0, as a so called loop-hole free violation of Bell's inequality shows, the transition of wave function reveals that the experiment were performed on a local real system. Neither loop-hole were properly closed.
